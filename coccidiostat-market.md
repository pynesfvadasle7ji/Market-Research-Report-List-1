<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coccidiostat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonantibiotic</li><li>Antibiotic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coccidiostat market is divided into two main types: nonantibiotic and antibiotic coccidiostats. Nonantibiotic coccidiostats are chemical agents that combat coccidiosis without being classified as antibiotics, often used in poultry and livestock to promote growth and improve feed efficiency. Antibiotic coccidiostats contain antimicrobial properties, targeting specific microorganisms to control coccidial infections. Both types play critical roles in animal health management, enhancing productivity and reducing disease impact in agricultural settings, but their regulatory frameworks and applications differ significantly.</p></p>
